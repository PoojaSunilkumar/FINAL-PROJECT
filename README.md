I used two datasets, **CICIDS 2017** and **UNSW-NB15**, with separate code files for each to ensure comprehensive evaluation and model robustness. These datasets differ in features, traffic patterns, and attack types, allowing for better generalization and cross-domain learning. By testing models on both datasets, I can assess their performance under diverse conditions, simulate real-world scenarios, and highlight strengths or limitations in handling various intrusion detection challenges.
