# <b>A Robust Machine Learning Based System for Identification of Network Intrusions with Data Balancing</b> <div align="center">
Intrusion detection systems' (IDSs) ability to protect company communication is crucial to 
cybersecurity. The reason for this is because intrusion detection systems play a crucial role as 
the initial defence against harmful assaults (Jaradat, Barhoush and Easa, 2022) (Bharadiya, 
2023). Intruder detection using machine learning is becoming increasingly popular (Hossain 
and Islam, 2023), but it still has some limitations that may be efficiently overcome by 
integrating diverse designs(Mohammad et al., 2024). So, this study's goal is to improve an 
efficiency of various IDS machine learning frameworks by addressing these issues through 
the application of data balancing approaches on two prominent datasets, the UNSWNB15 and 
the CIC-IDS-2017.
